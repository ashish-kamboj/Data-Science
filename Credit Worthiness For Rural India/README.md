## Problem Statement
In the Banking industry, loan applications are generally approved after a thorough background check of the customer's repayment capabilities. Credit Score plays a significant role in identifying
customer's financial behavior (specifically default). However, people belonging to rural India don't have a credit score and it is difficult to do a direct assessment.
